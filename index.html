                            <p> Backstage at the Richard Rodgers Amphitheater, a man languidly plucked his cello while dancers sprawled out on the floor stretching their legs. They were getting ready to perform at the Harlem Arts Festival. <br><br>
                                The annual celebration in Marcus Garvey Park featured local up-and-coming artists who don't have stages uptown to showcase their work. <br><br> <!-- <p>FILL IN WITH WORDS. MAYBE CHANGE COLOR</p> -->
                                The few spaces that are available, such as the Apollo Theater and Harlem Stage, are union houses that charge exorbitant fees most new artists can&#39;t afford, said Chelsea Goding, who helped launch the festival with two friends in 2010. <br><br>
                                Union houses not only have high fees but a base number of tickets must be sold in order to break even on union expenses. <br><br>
                                &#34Per union regulation, you have to have one person doing each thing," she said. "If you need someone to do lighting, that&#39;s one person to pay. If you need another person changing music, that&#39;s another person to pay.&#34 <br><br>
                                The concept of the festival was created by JJ El-Far who would run daily by the Richard Rodgers Amphitheatre.

                            <p>El-Far brought on her close friend Neal Ludevig, who was a tour manager with a background in music, and he in turn brought on his middle-school friend, Goding, who had a background in dance and arts management. They held the first festival in 2011.<br><br>
                               &#34The art scene in Harlem is so robust and thriving,&#34 said Ludevig. &#34As the identity in Harlem changes we want to make sure we&#39;re not forgetting who the main Harlemites are.&#34 <br><br> <!-- <p>FILL IN WITH WORDS. MAYBE CHANGE COLOR</p> -->
                              The festival helps artists by connecting them with other prominent artists and providing resources such as discounted studio time and physical therapy. In the last few months the festival has worked with The Apollo, Columbia University, NYC Kids' Fest, and Studio Museum through art collaborations and performances. <br><br>
                              &#34We almost act like an agency in terms of presenting people … and enhancing their visibility,&#34 said Ludevig.<br><br> <!-- <p>FILL IN WITH WORDS. MAYBE CHANGE COLOR</p> -->
                              The Harlem Arts Festival had 116 volunteers at this year’s event, held June 25- 26,  and has presented over 200 artists since 2012. The artists are seen by some of New York&#39;s leading arts institutions such as The Apollo, The Hip Hop Theater Festival, and Alvin Ailey Dance Theater.<br><br>

                            <p>With 15 volunteers, the organization also hosts open mics, exhibitions for visual artists, workshops, and educational partnerships with Harlem School for the Arts, where artists are able to talk to students.  The organization has garnered support from Harlem cultural leaders such as Voza Rivers, chair of the Harlem Arts Alliance who sits on the Festival Advisory Board, and Simone Eccleston, interim director of Harlem Stage, who is part of the festival&#39;s artistic selection committee.<br><br> 
                                Goldman Sachs and Con Edison have sent volunteers to the event in the past and Green Mountain Energy has signed up to sponsor the festival for three years. The Harlem Community Development Corporation also pledged $5000 in 2015 which it quadrupled this year. <br><br>
                                Despite a torrential downpour that dampened last year’s festival, it still managed to draw about 1,500 people and 30 to 40 vendors. This year there were about 6,000 attendees, 50 vendors, and 43 artists participating.<br><br>
                                Marcus Garvey Park, at East 120th Street to East 124th Street, is home to the Richard Rodgers Amphitheater, which seats 1500-2000 people and is the second largest amphitheater in New York City, after the Delacorte Theater in Central Park. <a href=https://journalism.columbia.edu/>READ MORE...</a><br><br> <!-- <p>LINK TO FULL ARTICLE</p> -->
